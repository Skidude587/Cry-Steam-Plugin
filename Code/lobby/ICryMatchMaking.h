// Overview of ICryMatchMaking
// MatchMaking provides a way for gamers to find each other to play multi player game sessions.
// A gamer can host a session or search for a session to join.
// Custom game data can be added to a session to provide other gamers information about the game being played.
// When searching for games to join the results can be filtered so only games the gamer is interested in are returned.
//
// MatchMaking Setup
// Before MatchMaking can be used the games custom session data must be registered with a call to SessionRegisterUserData.
// The custom data is defined using an array of SCryLobbyUserData and can have a maximum of 64 elements.
// m_id should be a unique id used to identify the data item.
// In Live the session user data has to be defined with the xlast program and uploaded to Microsoft before matchmaking can be used.
// The xlast program will produce an h file with ID's for the user data and these ID's should be used.
// In NP due to limitations of the service, you should just use any UID (the matchmaking service will then place the values
// appropriately to fit) Key note : Only the first 8 int32 fields registered will be searchable/filterable.
// In CryLAN any UID can be used. It will happily use the same ID's defined for the underlying online service for each platform.
// The data types that can be used for custom session user data are
// eCLUDT_Int64, eCLUDT_Int32, eCLUDT_Int16, eCLUDT_Int8, eCLUDT_Float64, eCLUDT_Float32, eCLUDT_Int64NoEndianSwap
//
// MatchMaking on the host
// The host should start by calling SessionCreate specifying the data that describes the session.
// If the functions completes successfully this data will be returned to peers when they search for sessions.
// As well as the custom data, other session data that should be supplied is the number of public and private slots that are available for users to join.
// Private slots can only be joined by a users who are invited to the game while public slots can be joined by anybody.
// The session name should also be given.
// Some SDK's don't allow the session name to be set and will replace the name given, normally with the user name of the user who created the session.
// The final thing to set is if the match is ranked. In Live, ranked sessions do arbitration in the background.
//
// During a game it is common for the game data to change and hence the data returned by searches needs to change to reflect this. e.g The game moves on to a different map.
// The host has 2 functions it can call to update the changeable data. These functions can be called anytime during the lifetime of the session.
// SessionUpdate can be called to update the sessions custom user data and takes an array of SCryLobbyUserData containing the data items to update.
// SessionUpdateSlots can be called to update the number of public and private slots available for users to join. e.g a private game may want to be made public.
// The new total number of slots should always be greater of equal to the current number of users in the session.
//
// When ready to start gameplay the host should call SessionStart and send a message to the other peers telling them to do the same.
// In ranked sessions after SessionStart has been called no more users are allowed to join the session. In unranked session users will still be allowed to join.
// When gameplay is finished SessionEnd should be called and a message should be sent to the other peers to tell them to do the same.
// If ICryStats is being used for leaderboards then writing to the leaderboards should be done between SessionStart and SessionEnd.
// In Live the leaderboard data written is sent to the Live servers when SessionEnd is called.
// If the game wishes to start gameplay again with the same session then SessionStart can be called again. e.g the same group of players moving on to another round.
//
// When the session is complete SessionDelete should be called this will free up all resources used by the session and stop the session being adverised
// so it will no longer be returned in searches.
//
// MatchMaking on the peers
// Before a peer can join a session it must find a CrySessionID of a session to join.
// There are 2 ways a CrySessionID can be obtained.
// A call to SessionSearch can be made that will return sessions that match the SCrySessionSearchParam structure passed in.
//
// The SCrySessionSearchParam structure passed in contains all the information needed to filter the results returned so only sessions
// the user is interested in are returned.
// In Live all the search types must also be defined in the xlast program and uploaded to Microsoft before they can be used.
// The h file the xlast program creates will contain ID's for each search type. m_type should be set to the ID of the search being done.
// Other systems can use any ID.
// An array of SCrySessionSearchData is also given that is used to filter sessions.
// An SCrySessionSearchData contains an SCryLobbyUserData that is compared against the equivalent item in the session using the ECrySessionSearchOperator given.
// Only sessions that return true for all the SCrySessionSearchData's given will be returned.
// Due to the limitations of PSN if PSN support is needed searches should only be defined using up to 8 int32 fields.
// m_numFreeSlots should be set to only return sessions with at least this many free public slots.
// m_ranked should be set to return ranked or unranked matches.
// m_maxNumReturn should be set to return at most this many sessions.
//
// The callback passed to SessionSearch will be called with the session information of each session found.
// If the error code is eCLE_SuccessContinue then a session is also provided and the callback will be called again.
// If the error code is eCLE_SuccessUnreachable then a session is also provided and the callback will be called again.
// This code indicates that a connection attempt to this session will fail most likely due to incompatible NATs.
// If the error code is eCLE_Success then the session will be NULL and the search is complete.
//
// The second way a CrySessionID can be obtained is by the user accepting an invite or joining a session in progress via the underlying SDKs UI.
// To get the CrySessionID when the user does this RegisterEventInterest should be called with eCLSE_InviteAccepted and a callback in ICryLobby during startup.
// When the callback is called the game should join the given CrySessionID.
//
// When a CrySessionID has been obtained call SessionJoin to try and join this session.
// The join could fail if the session has become unjoinable since the CrySessionID was obtained e.g Session has become full or the host has called SessionDelete.
// It can also fail due to incompatable NAT types.
//
// SessionStart should be called when gameplay starts. A message should be sent from the host to indicate when this is.
// SessionEnd should be called when gameplay ends. A message should be sent from the host to indicate when this is or if the user decides to leave.
//
// When the session is complete SessionDelete should be called this will free up all resources used by the session.
